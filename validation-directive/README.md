# ValidationDirective

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.1.
- The validation directive uses string or object as input
- If input is string, it will search for property from validation.json file in assets. Validation attributes are dependent on object under that property.
- If input is of type object, then that object will define the validation attributes.
